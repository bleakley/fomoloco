    <p>This is a drop in multiplayer stock-trading game that uses its own server! It was made for the Brackeys jam but it is hosted at <a target="_blank" href="http://fomolo.co">fomolo.co</a>.</p>
    <p>Play with your friends! If you start a game at the same time, it is very likely that you will play together. Buy low and sell high! Unlock secret upgrades! And remember- apes are stronger together! 🐵🐵🐵</p>
